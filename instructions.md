Search the internet to find an efficient way to create a custom debian sid iso with the following features: I must be able to create custom btrfs layout following the opensuse's layout with lvm; I need to be able to create btrfs subvolumes during the installation; and the post-install script will be my own script for the home user with sudo priviledges; I need to be able to create custom configurations during the installing both for the home user and the root user;  I need to be able to encrypt the whole disk except /boot and /boot/efi folders; the swap lvm volume must be at least 16GiB; both the /boot and /boot/efi must be 512MiB; I will create a passoword during the installation process for the encrypted partition instead of a key file; I need to able to create a list to install certain debian packages; I also need to be able to run a script after installation has been done; make sure iso uses the sid channel of debian; the package lists should include everything debian usually includes; the installer must be able to use grub to boot from the encrypted disk. All these tasks must occur automatically using a predefined set of files
